Questions 11 to 15:

11- Data warehouse is an information system that stores historical and commutative data from single or multiple sources.
    Database is designed to record data whereas the Data warehouse is designed to analyze data.

12- Online transaction processing (OLTP) captures, stores, and processes data from transactions in real time. 
    Online analytical processing (OLAP) uses complex queries to analyze aggregated historical data from OLTP systems.
    Online Analytical Processing consists of a type of software tools that are used for data analysis for business decisions. 
    OLAP provides an environment to get insights from the database retrieved from multiple database systems at one time.

13- There are three prominent data warehouse characteristics:
    Integrated: The way data is extracted and transformed is uniform, regardless of the original source.
    Time-variant: Data is organized via time-periods (weekly, monthly, annually, etc.).
    Non-volatile: A data warehouse is not updated in real-time. It is periodically updated via the uploading of data, protecting it from the influence of momentary change.

14- Star schemas are optimized for querying large data sets and are used in data warehouses and data marts to support OLAP cubes, 
    business intelligence and analytic applications, and ad hoc queries. A star schema is diagramed by surrounding each fact with its associated dimensions. 
    The resulting diagram resembles a star.

15- Set Theory as a Language(SETL) is a high-level programming language that's based on the mathematical theory of sets. 
    It was developed in the early 1970's by mathematician Professor J.
